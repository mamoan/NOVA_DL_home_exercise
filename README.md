# NOVA_DL_home_exercise
These are the scripts used to complete the home exercise in the NOVA deep learning course.

The 9 scripts are for the most part numbered in chronological order, i.e. in the order that they need to be run in order to complete the whole YOLO model process, from preprocessing, splitting the data into train/val, making the models, and evaluating them using machine learning metrics and remote sensing metrics.
